<div>
<h1>Enough and Too</h1>
You can say the same thing in three different ways:
<div class="withborder">
<ul >
<li>I couldn't carry that bag of wheat. It was too heavy.</li>
<li>The bag of wheat was so heavy that I couldn't carry it.</li>
<li>The bag of wheat was too heavy to carry.</li>
</ul>
</div>
Some more examples like this:
<ol>
<li>
<p>The pencil is too long to put in your pencil case.</p>
<p>(and not too long to put <i>it</i> in your pencil case)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The horse is too tall to climb on without a chair.</p>
<p>(and not too tall to climb on <i>it</i> without a chair)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The story was not exciting enough to remember.</p>
<p>(and not exiting enough to remember <i>it</i>)</p>
</li>

</ol>

<h4>Now it's up to you!</h4>
