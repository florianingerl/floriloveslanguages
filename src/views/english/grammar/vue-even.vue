<h1>Even</h1>
<section>
With this tutoriel, I want to prove that <span style="font-style:italic">even</span> I can write one. And I want to teach
you the correct use of "even". 
</section>

<section>
Let's look at some more examples:

<ol class="exemple">
<li>Dave is a workaholic. He works even on Sundays.</li>
<li>Florian never visits his relatives, not even on Christmas Eve.</li>
<li>Florian never eats cake, not even the one his grandmother has made.</li>
</ol>

As we saw in the above examples, we use "even" to say that something is <em>unusual</em> or <em>suprising</em>.
More examples:

<ol class="exemple">
<li>Hermann can't digest raw, healthy food - not even ice lettuce. (And ice lettuce is really easy to digest.)</li>
<li>Denis is so stupid that he always wears his mask, even when he sleeps. (And there aren't many people who are so stupid.)</li>
</ol>
