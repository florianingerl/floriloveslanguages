<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

Fred was a very stubborn fellow. His ideas were so rigid that it was hard to
collaborate with him. Nevertheless, Fred was the head of a 5-men-6-women company which made toys for very small children.
Fred was also a really superstitious man and he liked to start all the staff meetings by singing a Christmas song to bring peace and love into his company. So this is how they started the first meeting of the week which was scheduled to discuss a big new project.
It was June, the most children-loving among the company's employees, that began to speak about their big new project. All the others listened very attentively. "As we all now, this new project of ours will be very costly unless we have the toys made in China. But I'm still very motivated to set off the project, because if it succeeds, it will warm up the hearts of so many young children and their mothers! "

"Should anything go wrong, we had better set up an insurance." contributed Edwin, the
company's chairman. "Me in fact, I am not sure whether there is a market for such
totally new toys."
"As of me", said Vanessa, the creative director, I want to create the best toy which we can all be proud of."
"Great, I agree" said Fred. "Now let's brainstorm ideas for this new toy."
"I like the idea of a toy that immediately destroys itself when you try to operate it in a wrong but obvious way. That way, the child immediately would have to buy a new toy and we could earn thus twice the money!" suggested Dave, who often came up with rather funny or even ridiculous ideas.

"I fancy the idea of a toy that's similiar to a stick. A two-player-game can be played with it. One player has to punch the other one in some limb and ..... " Sally began, but her idea was not yet so sophisticated that she could formulate it all.

Most of the team was a bit reluctant about Sally's idea because they found it too violent for children. In the end, Fred came up with the best idea and since he was the boss, no one could say no to him.

"I want to build a huge doll house on top of the mountain next to our city. I want to fill it with toys so children can go there and play all day if they, of course, buy a ticket."
With no objections coming up, the meeting was concluded and after this one-hour-work-day , everyone could savely go home to care for their respective families while knowing that their toys were at this very moment made by some very cheap Chinese craftsmen.



Edwin went home swiftly, a smile on his face, very satisfied with the outcome of the meeting.
After opening the door with his keys, he announced his return by calling the name of his wife.
His wife looked both happy and tired when she came to welcome him. Just like most days, it was her who took care of their altogether 6 children that day, hence she was exhausted. But it was important to them to come all together every evening for dinner exactly at 8:23 PM.

<VueExercise instruction="Choose between all together or altogether" lg="en">

Then they usually played a few of the games that Edwin's company made and this activity never became dull.
In fact, you could say, that Edwin himself was still a kid. But of course, if needed, he became their responsible father.

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Put the words in the correct order">

<VueWordOrder lg="en" :sentences="['My father had always wanted to travel to Greece.',
'You should never eat candies for breakfast.',

The whole family played together with various toys until one of Edwin's children said:
"Daddy, I feel nauseous. Please help me!"
Edwin and his wife didn't think much of it first but their little boy was still feeling unwell a few hours later too.
With a few comforting words and a warm tea from the mother, the coming of an ambulance could as usual be avoided. It was just a normal stomach ache resulting from too much candies.
In the end, they stopped the game playing, brought the ill child into his bed and seized this occasion to go all together into bed earlier today.

<p>
Meanwhile, Vanessa who was a young professional in her twenties, spent her evening with her mother. 

"Such a lovely evening!" said her mother but Vanessa could not have disagreed more. 
She was young and beautiful so she wanted to be in a bar meeting handsome men instead of staying at home with her mother.
</p>


<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with such, such a or so!">
<VueGaps lg="en" gaptext="What a pity that Vannessa didn't think that she was {so} handsome herself.  Otherwise, she could have saved {so} much time putting on her make-up.
In spite of a few freckles and a few pimples, Vanessa had {such a} beautiful face. A few men in the bars turned their head towards her, found her attractive and then immediately wanted to marry her. But Vanessa dispised {such} overly direct behaviour.
Vanessa felt {so} bored and disappointed by these men that she decided to go back home to her mother.  She felt unhappy with her romantic life and thought that she was {such a} failure. {Such} ideas were also reinforced by her mother who always told her that it's shameful if a woman is not married by 20 years old." >
</VueGaps>
</VueExercise>

"Why don't you find yourself a rich husband and settle down with him somewhere in the country!" her mother kept saying. "Instead, you keep eating these candies that distort your face with pimples and lose your time in the bar.
Upon hearing her mother's words for the thousandth time, Vanessa wished she had rather stayed with her father when her parents divorced.
"I had better go to bed now, Mum, I have work tomorrow" she said to get rid of her mother and she went to her room.

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with had better or should!">
<VueGaps lg="en" gaptext="Sally had already passed her twentieth too, but unlike Vanessa she had a serious relationship with a smart man working at the univerity as a history teacher. It {should} be surprising that a smart professor and Sally, being rather daft, can fit together. But opposites seem to attract each other.
However, the professor knew that he {had better} not speak about the complicated details of his job because Sally wouldn't understand." >
</VueGaps>
</VueExercise>

The university professor's name was Anton by the way. Anton appreciated Sally because - though sometimes a bit daft - of her refreshing laugther and her good energy.
And Sally liked Anton because of his wisdom and because he was a great chess player. However, they had a problem since Anton was already in his 50s and the big age gap was not appreciated by either of their families.
"Why did you choose this fellow who is more than 20 years older than you. He could be your father!" her mother often reproached her. "Have you got anything in common? Can you two spend your free time together?"

"No, we haven't got anything special in common. At least, we don't have an on-and-off relationship!"
But no matter how many times did Sally try to explain her relationship to her mother, sadly she never understood it. Still, Sally could have never imagined giving up on her love for Anton.

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Choose the replacement of to say that fits best!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptext="['\'With your skills, you will easily find a well-paid job.\' {predicted|replied|told} his teacher to Anton.',

'His neighbour {whispered|yelled|predicted} the correct solutions in his ear during the exam.']" >

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>


So because Sally couldn't share her feelings freely with her mother, she decided to confide to her friend instead.

"I love Anton so much that I want to marry him next week."
"Difficult to keep up with all your news!" remarked his friend similing a bit. "First your company that wants to set off this new big project and then you yourself, who wants to marry this grandfather after just 2 months that you know each other!"
"He only has two grandsons, that's not a lot!" defended herself Sally.

"Still, if I were you, I'd wait a few more months before proposing to him" advised her friend.
But Sally was not only daft, but also very stubborn, two qualities that often appear in combination.
That's why such advice usally entered into Sally's left ear and existed through the right one without leaving any trace in her brain.
So she asked her friend: "How would you give him the proposal? During a nice dinner with dimly lit candles?"
"Yes, that's a fantastic idea! That's how I will do it. Plus, we will also play this new game that my company created for couples. It'll be very romantic, thank you for the idea!"

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

"I don't want to bother you any longer, Hannah, said Sally, but can I still ask you a favour? Can you come shopping with me this weekend? I need to find a wedding dress!"
Hannah recongnized that it was of no use to repeat to Sally that
she had better wait another 4 months before the wedding.
Always appreciating nice clothing herself, she was immediately all excited about choosing a wedding dress. "What about going to Beate's fashion store?" suggested Hannah.
"Sure, let's go there on Saturday at 3 pm" agreed Sally. "You know, Hannah, I have one more thing that I'm worried about. Unfortunately, I'm not a children-loving person but Anton has three kids and two grandsons. I don't know if I'll be a good step-mother and step-grandmother to them."
"No!" replied Hannah who wanted to give some reassurance to her friend. "You like children, otherwise you coudn't work for your company. And you really managed to entertain my son by playing chess with him, when I once asked you to take care of him."
"Okay, that's true. I guess now I will need to restart my mediation classes to avoid all the stress that comes with a wedding. I need to start breathing correctly again. Will you come with me there too, please?" asked her friend.
That was the usual thing with Sally! Her ideas and plans changed so quickly that it was difficult to keep up with them! Let's now leave Hannah and Sally to themselves and see what Fred is doing in this very moment.

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with either let or leave!">

So, as already mentioned, let's move now to Fred, the director of the toy company. His wife was also a very ambitious business women, and none of the two had a lot of time to care for their son Alexander.
His wife, Miranda had this habit of staying in her office until midnight to work, especially when her company faced challenges. This was one of the many drawbacks of having successful parents as a young boy. Although they had a lot of money, but not a lot of time together.
Alexander struggled for a tiny bit of attention from his parents. Up until now, he hadn't got their attention, let alone their love.
That's why he was really unenthusiastic when one evening his dad came home and shared the news with him:

"I took on a big new project at work, son! We will create a house on top of the hill next to the city for the children of our town! It will be a place where they can come and play. Isn't it wonderful?"
What Alexander didn't need, was of course another toy or something similiar. His room was already packed with all these made-in-China cheap products of his dad's company. And what he also didn't need, was to be once again the test person for another stupid toy or a stupid toy house. That's why, not even letting his father finishing his speak, he started rebeling against him: "No, I will not take part in your business stuff once again! I want to write a book. And not lose my time with your stupid toys! "
His father of course had difficulty accepting his answer but at least, he left him alone after his rejection. However, when his fashion designer mother came home, unfortunately she also had some news:

"My dear son, I'm launching a new sport clothes line for young boys and I need you to model for me!" said his mother.

"No! Leave me alone! I just want to be free and self-independent!" replied Alexander.

"Yesterday, I finished writing another short story. I have now written 20 short stories altogether. Why don't you two help me to find a publisher for my stories? " Alexander asked his parents.
"But you're only 13 years old, you are too young to publish anything" objected his father.

"Yes, plus if your stories are not the best, our family will be laughed at by everyone! I don't want people to think we're clowns" added his mother.

"Why don't we go out to a nice restaurant all together and discuss what it still needs so that my stories can be published? " suggested Alexander to his parents.
"You were defiant with both of us this evening, Alexander, so why do you think we would say yes to this request and spend money on a nice dinner in a restaurant when you don't help us?" asked his father.
"What? You haven't got enough money to afford a dinner at a restaurant? That's why you work all day?" exclaimed Alexander indiginantly. "Then I will go alone to the restaurant and pay with my pocket money." And with these words, Alexander considered the discussion as finished and we can now leave the three of them.

<p>
Let's look to Sally and Hannah.
Finally, Satruday morning arrived and Sally met her friend, Hannah in front of the city's most expensive bridal shop, Beate's fashion. Although Sally didn't have a lot of money, nor an engagement ring for the moment but she didn't hesitate to explore her wedding dress options. But there were so many dresses that she felt really unsure about which one to choose.

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with a conjunction of coordination!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :same="true" :gaptext="['{Not only|} is he very smart, but also very sympathetic.',

'My dad wants to buy {either|} a new Porsche or a Ferrari.',
'Do you take tea {or|} just hot water with milk?']">
</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

The shop assistant came to help. "Unsure, which dress to choose?" she asked. "Have you already seen the one from our advertisement? A really brilliant, new young and talented fashion designer, a rising star, created it. Here it is."
With these words, the shop assistant handed over an in fact nice-looking white wedding-dress and the price label must have been somewhere hidden.
Sally tried on the beautiful dress and she instantly felt like a princess so she decided to buy the dress. But the problem was that she only had a few coins in her pocket and didn't have enough money to pay for it. But suddenly she had a genious idea.

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with either litte, a little, few or a few">
<VueMCGaps lg="en"  :same="true" :gaptext="['{A few|} points may require some additional explanation.',

</VueExercise>
</p>

<p>
"We should go to the casino and play with some games so we can try to win some money!" Sally suggested to her friend, Hannah.
It's a known fact that small coins give you luck. Since Sally had a lot of small coins in her pocket, she didn't need to gamble for long. No! She immediately won the money for the dress.
</p>

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with either one or won" >
<VueMCGaps lg="en" gaptext="Anton immediately {won} Sally's heart when they met. Sally only had {one} good friend, Hannah. That's why Sally could need another {one} and was thus glad to have {won} Anton's affection.">
</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

<p>
After winning the money, they quickly rushed back to the shop to buy the most beautiful garment Sally had ever seen in her life. They still had some money left afterwards so Sally had another great idea:
"I want to go and get a new tattoo on my arm!" she announced. "But you already have 41 tattoos, Sally! What do you want this time?" asked Hannah.
"I have a new favourite animal. The snake! I want that!"
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, a new day had dawned at Edwin's house. Weekend!
Last week, Edwin had installed a few new computer games on his children's computers, but now he was afraid that this had been a great mistake. It was difficult know to  bring them away from the computer and have a word with them.
But his wife, Brigitte was happy about the video games. She was very tired of having 6 children and she also felt lonely from time to time because she didn't have time for herself or for spending time with her friends.
Before the video games, Brigitte always had to make up small stories to entertain her children. Not having heard at least 3 of them, Ben, her youngest, refused to fall asleep. Since the computer computer games, Ben could still not sleep because the blue light from the computer screen he looked at so late, prevented his sleep. But at least Brigitte wasn't bothered by that.

<p>
Erwin knew about the loneliness of his wife so he offered to take care of the children alone that Saturday afternoon.
"Don't worry, we'll have a lot of fun at home! Go spend time with your friends!" he told his wife.
</p>

<p>
But Brigitte kept worrying because she knew that her children were dependent on her. Usually her main preoccupation was her family but she gladly accepted her husband's offer and excitedly got ready to meet her friends.
So Brigitte met Vanessa at a restaurant in town to exchange some gossip which pleased very much Alexander who always needed such material for his next book and who was sitting alone at a table nearby listing to the chatting of the two women.
"I have an interesting story for you today" started Vanessa."One of my colleagues, Sally went and bought a marvelous wedding dress this week! But you know what's crazy? She's not even engaged yet!"
