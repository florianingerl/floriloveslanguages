Raw vegetable food should be the only nourishment taken by man. The habit of eating
cooked food should be abandoned in this world once for all. This is the unerring demand of
nature. The consumption of cooked food is the most terrible barbarism in the history of
mankind, a barbarism that no one seems to be aware of and to which everybody falls an
unconscious victim. No matter how strange the idea may seem to some, it is the absolute truth
with which we cannot but acquiesce.

This truth became evident to me when, after 18 years of careful study and investigation, I
became convinced that the deaths of my 10-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter were caused
by unnatural nutrition. The great number of medical examinations carried out in Iran, France,
Germany and Switzerland in various attempts made to discover some specific disease in their
organisms and the subsequent administration of numerous remedies had a considerable share,
too, in bringing the tragedy to a head. My children died of the gradual emaciation and wasting
away of all their organs caused by unnatural feeding and poisonous medicines.

I have been able to penetrate into the secrets of medical science and to observe its good and
bad aspects all the more clearly, because I have not been inspired by the prospect of becoming a
doctor or of making any financial gains. My incentive has been in the first place the wish to do my
best for the recovery of the health of my beloved children, and later the ardent desire to
perpetuate their memory by being useful to humanity.

Another factor which has contributed to my better realization. of the shortcomings of
medical science is the entirely new system by which I have carried out my studies by selfeducation,
free from the encumbrance of an academic programme. I have never become
intoxicated by the exaggerated claims of progress made on behalf of medical science or by all the
fanciful tales of the fabulous benefits to be derived from medicines. I have approached these
questions with a critical mind and have always laid greater stress on their shortcomings.

Moreover, I have constantly kept in view the fact that, in spite of the existence of millions of qualified doctors and a large number of Nobel prize-winners,
civilized man falls victim to various illnesses more often than any other animals, and diseases like
sclerosis, diabetes, heart attacks and cancer increase at an alarming rate, threatening to wipe out
mankind from the face of the earth. I have not wasted my time in memorizing the symptoms of
diseases, the names and doses of medicines and those numerous complicated formulae that are
seldom needed, because I have never had the intention of sitting for examinations and obtaining
degrees. Instead, so far as possible, I have devoted my time to the study of a great many branches
of science and to the examination of the multifarious sources of knowledge, from the fundamental

The results of 18 years of painstaking study and labor have been embodied in a work of two
large volumes, the first of which, a book of 568 pages, was published in Armenian in 1960.
<h2>The Efficient Operation of Every Factory is Subject to the
Uniform Supply of All the Raw Materials
Specified by the Engineer</h2>
Until the discovery of fire, along with the rest of the animal kingdom, man had developed
and carried out his evolution by the consumption of natural, raw nourishment. But since the
discovery of fire, without much reflection, men have put natural foodstuffs on the fire, have
destroyed their essential constituents, have debased them and have then nourished their bodies
with them. As a direct consequence, there have resulted all the diseases from which all mankind
suffer today.

The human organism is the masterpiece of nature. Man is the most complicated and the
most perfect living factory constructed by the unceasing efforts of nature over a period of 1.5
billion years. Simultaneously, with the construction of this factory, our wonderful nature has
made use of the rays of the sun to develop all the raw materials which are necessary to coordinate
the thousands of complicated operations of our organism and to ensure corresponding
production. Furthermore, nature has placed those raw materials in their entire perfection and in
the faultless harmony of their various constituents in a tiny grain of the corn, in a pulpy seed of
a pomegranate, in a berry of the grape or in a leaf of a plant. Each of the "paltry" foodstuffs taken
separately contains all those factors that are necessary to keep alive the living organism of a being
like man.

In the material world the smallest deviation from the details developed by an engineer for
the smooth working of the mechanism of a factory, or a fault in the raw materials specified to
ensure its normal productivity, results in a corresponding breakdown in the operation of the
plant. In the same way, the slightest deterioration or alteration in the raw materials prescribed by nature to ensure the
smooth operation of the complicated processes of the human organism causes disorders in the
normal biological functions of our organs and these disorders appear in the form of diseases.

The various methods employed by man in destroying or degenerating the fully-balanced
raw materials prescribed by nature for the normal operation of his organism do not bear
thinking. For that purpose, civilized man has invented demoniacal factories, ovens, furnaces and
kitchens. Every degeneration in the quality of natural foodstuffs is followed by a corresponding
degeneration in the human organism. Natural nutrition ensures the normal operation, of
our organism, while unnatural nutrition is followed by an abnormal discharge of its
functions. The multiplicity of illnesses is the result of the great diversity of degeneration in the
constituents of natural foodstuffs.

Provided that all its needs are satisfied by the laws of nature, the human organism, which is
the most perfect organism in the animal kingdom, can live in excellent health from a
minimum of 150 years to a maximum of 200-250 years. Cooked foodstuffs force human
organs to work in several times their normal capacity, tire them out prematurely, cause various
illnesses and shorten man's life to a fraction of its normal span. In the present age of scientific
advance, man could get rid of all the diseases by complete abstinence from cooked food and
he could then devote his energies to the study of the problems of longevity only.
Simultaneously, with natural nutrition, man must also make certain that the rest of his
natural requirements are satisfied. These are clean air, early sleeping, early rising, physical
labor, abstinence from artificial heating, cleanliness, and so forth.

<h4>Direct and Indirect Nutritional Diseases</h4>
Nutritional diseases are divided into two main categories: direct and indirect
ailments. Direct nutritional diseases are those that are caused by a superabundance of certain
nutritional constituents or a deficiency of others. Fire and animal foodstuffs have the effect of
concentrating and increasing the proteins and the fats in the diet, while at the same time
eliminating substances of high nutritive value. Science has so far been able to recognize only a
negligible number of these substances, which have been named vitamins and without which
life cannot exist. Among the direct nutritional diseases are to be placed all chronic disorders
and deficiency diseases. The diseases develop with extreme slowness and secrecy. So long as the
disease has not entered its final stages and the organs have not stopped working, the individual
regards himself as healthy. In the event of partial and mixed vitamin deficiencies, the disease
does not appear by the symptoms particular to avitaminosis, that are described in
textbooks; rather it makes its appearance by complaints which are not easy to explain.

<h3>Raw Eating</h3>
Indirect digestive ailments are the infectious diseases. In the human organism there
live usually a large variety of microbes which in normal circumstances render useful
service to the organism and which are subject to the control of specialized (differentiated)
human cells, to whose commands they compliantly submit. But through faulty nutrition the
degenerated and emaciated cells are so weakened that by the Law of Survival those
microbes get the upper hand, set themselves free from the control of those cells, rebel against
their masters, become pathogenic and cause the infectious diseases so well-known to us.
Sometimes the invading army of assailing microbes, which would have met with irresistible
opposition in a healthy organism and would have been destroyed at once, do not meet with
such opposition in an emaciated organism and causes its specific infection.

In the second volume of my Armenian book, I have devoted considerable space to the
problem of infectious diseases, for the examination of which I have analyzed certain portions
of the first volume of the treatise on "Pathological Anatomy and the Pathogenesis of Human
Diseases" by the eminent Soviet scientist I.V. Davydovsky, published in 1956. By means of
numerous convincing facts, the author proves that it is not the microbes themselves that are
guilty of causing infectious diseases, but the poor condition of the body, the decline in its
power of immunity. But unfortunately, like all food addicts,* Davydovsky, too, is unable to
explain how we can restore that immunity or, better still, prevent its decline.

The fear of microbes has so frightened men that to escape them they have recourse to
the most dangerous measures and yet they obtain entirely opposite results. The cooking of
raw foodstuffs in order to avoid microbes is one of the most fateful mistakes in medical
science. We cannot exterminate microbes from the face of the earth. They are found
everywhere, they will always exist and can enter our organisms through multifarious channels.
In particular, by cooking our food we first of all weaken the resistance of our cells and then we
destroy in our foodstuffs those natural antibiotics that are destined by nature to fight against
microbes. Even those doctors who are addicted to cooked food confirm that many vitamins,
which are destroyed on the fire, have bacterial properties. That is why animals that feed on
rubbish heaps are not nearly so subject to infectious diseases as man is.

Many cooked-eaters are inclined to believe that because man has fed on cooked food for
centuries on end, he must be accustomed to it and may now suffer if he starts eating raw food
all at once. In other words, if we have filled a motor-car with dirty and inferior petrol for a certain time, the engine may have become used

First of all, a period of a few thousand years is nothing compared with the 1.5 billion years
during which, along with his ancestors, man lived and developed exclusively on raw food. Besides,
that man has not, in fact, become habituated to cooked food is proven by the very existence of
diseases, which disappear and the organism then returns to its normal functions once man has
recourse to raw nourishment.

It is true that by the laws of evolution our organism tries to adapt itself to the food it
receives, but not in the way that some people imagine. Those nutritive constituents of food that
are essential for the complicated processes and the specialized major functions of the cells are
easily destroyed under the influence of fire. Therefore, the foodstuffs that are considered
nutritious by cooked-eaters lack those essential constituents, but instead they have an
abundant supply of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, several times in excess of the demands of
the cells.
