Tears were pouring down Lisa's cheeks. Why?
She had gone for a walk with her beloved rabbit that morning but her rabbit sadly got lost. Lisa didn't have a map with her, let alone a telephone to call for help.
"Why did my beloved rabbit want to get away from me?"-Lisa cried to herself.
The more she thought about this, the more confused she got. Still, she decided to find her rabbit, so she kept walking on the path that led to a forest.
What a miracle! Once she stepped into the forest and inhaled the fresh air, her thoughts immediately changed into good ones. One of her new ideas: she could attract her rabbit by laying down some carrots in all her room back at home.
So Lisa quickly left the forrest and went to a grocery store to buy carrots for her plan. She found the vegetables at the front of the store and after having paid, she hurried home to execute her plan.
"Unless my rabbit has caught a cold and a blocked nose, it will certainly smell the scent of the carrots and will not be able to resist and come quickly home"- Lisa thought.
Lisa hoped and waited for hours for her rabbit but sadly, it didn't show up. She started to suspect that her rabbit might have gotten into some trouble and needed her help, so she went back to the forest. Once she got there, she spotted a small monkey on one of the trees.
Suprisingly, the monkey could also speak English and adressed his speach to her: "Are you still searching for your rabbit? I could tell you where it has gone but I don't give you the information for free."
Although Lisa was really surprised by this speaking monkey and she was even a little afraid of what the monkey might want from her, but she was determined to find her rabbit and wouldn't give up because of a small challenge.
"So just tell me what you want in return for giving me your information?" -Lisa told the monkey.
"I want you to get me some bananas. But you have to prove to me that you are a strong human, unlike the others who usually come here. So you have to climb a tree and get the bananas that way. You can't just simply buy them in one of your shops." requested the monkey.
Being a pretty good climber, Lisa had no difficulty in climbing one of the huge banana trees admist this English forest. Whereas bringing a banana down was more difficult because she was so hungry that she ate the first five ones she could reach immediately herself.
The monkey didn't like that she ate the first bananas herself instead of giving them to him. But upon receiving his share of bananas, he told Lisa:

"Your rabbit was exploring the river nearby when it was caught by a fox. You should hurry if you want to see it alive ever again" the monkey informed Lisa before quickly disappearing.
In this forest, Lisa knew only one fox and that one must certainly hide in his hole next to the big oak tree in the middle of the forest.
Lisa started to run towards the oak tree in the hope of saving and finally getting her rabbit back.
The most expensive map or cell phone could not have led Lisa the way. But Lisa knew the forrest very well and reached the oak tree in no time. There she found her rabbit, imprisoned in a cage.
Had she arrived a little bit later, she might not have found her rabbit alive because hiding in the bushes, she could see the fox preparing for dinner. She quickly needed to come up with a plan to save her beloved pet.
Nobody came unexpectedly out of the bushes to hand over a key for the cage. So what to do? She put on her cleaning gloves, went to the fox and asked him to hand her over the key for the cage because she was the cleaning service.
Lisa didn't want to fail so she even offered to do the cleaning for free. The fox really appreciated this offer and handed over the key.

"Also clean the rabbit! I want to eat a clean one." requested the fox.
Luckily, Lisa had brought a few of the carrots and the bananas with her and by telling the fox  that eating those beforehand would make the rabbit easier digestable afterwards, she could thus distract the fox and avoid him watching her.

Then she opened the cage and embrassed her beloved rabbit.
Her rabbit was really cute but not too clever, so first, it didn't even want to leave the cage. Therefore, Lisa had to pick it up to escape while the fox was not paying attention. 

Once they arrived home, Lisa promised to herself to never take his pet for a walk again.
