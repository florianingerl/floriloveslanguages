Katy, the cat, never trusted anyone. She kept 
often for herself and didn't have many friends.
There was a neighbour cat, Ben who tried to be friends with her but Katy was too stubborn to accept Ben's invitations to roam around together in the neighbourhood.
Having rejected all of Ben's approches, Katy was often alone and bored.
Katy was not only stubborn but she was also defiant towards the boss of the local cat gang. The boss was trying to get her to join the gang but Katy kept refusing him too.
No contacts whatsoever, she became a bit depressed without her realizing it.
On a rainy day when everything was damp on the streets, Katy suddenly had an interesting thought:

"I wish I could live in a nice, warm house with a loving family who takes care of me."
Maybe that wish originated from the recollections of her own family. She had had a loving father and mother who unfortunately already had passed away.
The more Katy reflected on her lost parents, the more she missed them. However, she also had 9 little siblings that were still alive but got adopted by humans when they had been all kittens.
Had Katy also been adopted by a nice, warm, loving family, she would most probably be much happier now. He suspected it was because of her ugly left eye which lay under a scar.

Should Katy be less insecure about her face, maybe she could have accepted Ben's approaches to become friends. As she realized this, she decided to seek out help from a therapist.
Ben had recommended to her that she had to visit Dr. Donald Mc Lorry, who treated the severe cases very well.
Dr. Donald McLorry suggested Katy to try to find her lost siblings and reconnect with them to feel love again. So Katy followed the advice and started to think about a plan.
The plan that Katy finally came up with was the following:
Break into one of the telephone boxes and try to phone all of the families of her siblings one after another. Given that these were 9 possibilities, surely one of them would succeed and she would get invited to a dinner.
So Katy waited for the night to fall so humans couldn't see her entering the phone box and calling the families. Sadly the first few calls were not successful because either the families were not at home or they didn't want to speak with her.

But the last family finally agreed to a meeting. Katy was really happy and so was her sibling.
Had the shops not already closed, Katy could have bought some paint to cover her ugly scar and to feel more secure, Thus she didn't and went directly to her sibling's house and knocked at the door.
Katy was a bit nervous about the dinner because she was a compulsive eater and liked to eat a lot.
After having been let in, Katy was very moved by the warm hug that her sister gave her.
In the end, although Katy tried to control her compulsive eating, she didn't manage to. But the family was so nice that they didn't reproach her at all.
Overwhelmed by how she had been received, Katy suggested to dance to some music after dinner. That Katy made a suggestion of her own hadn't occured in the last 10 years or so.
The only ostentatious gesture the family made during the night was showing her all their diamond rings. But Katy even considered this as a good sign because it showed her that they were wealthy. Deep in her heart, Katy hoped that the family would adopt her too.
What Katy didn't know was that this particular family was used to adopting animals all the time, also abandoned birds, dogs, rabbits, hamsters.
Katy barely could believe her luck when at the end of the night, the family asked her to stay and be their 11th cat in the house. Not being able to form words, she just nodded her head to accept the offer. 

This is how the stubborn, lonely Katy found a family and lived the rest of her life as a happy cat.
