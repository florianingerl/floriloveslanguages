It was a bittercold winter and the fox Brian was suffering
heavily. What could he do to warm up?

He thought he could go back to the forest and maybe he would be lucky and he would meet again the lad he saw last time. Despite of the cold, he decided to go back to the forest.
Maybe they could become friends. Not only could this new friend chase away the feeling of coldness by playing with him, but also they could make a fire after looking for dry wood.
Most of all, what Brian liked was non ostentatious people or environment. That was really important for him. And he would always be stubborn with that and he could even become defiant about it.

hide
Since the other lad had been wearing shabby clothes
last time that he met him, he was clearly not ostentatious. "How can I find him?" thought Brian. "Where might this fox be hiding from the cold now? He might have chosen whatever place that spreads some warmth. Maybe a hole in a tree or in the earth. "

Whereever he's hiding, I'm sure to find him anyway. He will probably be happy to see me bacause he knows we'll play and I'll offer him a warm place to rest.

"We could also eat fresh food together because all the ice has kept my provisions fresh. I still have a lot of rabbits, chickens and deers in my fridge." thought Brian.

And I still have some of this very special potion in my fridge that I really don't want to spoil. Maybe I could share it with Brian, he might enjoy it.
pretty
tiny
Suddendly, he had the idea that he could attract the fox by going with his potion into the forest and spreading its marvellous scent. He was pretty sure that this idea would work. No fox could possibly resist this delicious potion.  
But he would have to be careful that no other animal would even receive the tiniest bit of their potion.

proud
Fortunately, the gap between the forest and the valley was full of snow and then he could easily go across this gap.  He felt quite proud for thinking of using the potion to attract Brian.
path
to run
While running over the snow-filled gap between valley and forest, Brian realized that
the running warmed him up. Not only was the valley full of thick snow, but it was also reached by some rays of sunlight. 
And who approched him there wearing these shabby clothes? "What a coincidence!" exclaimed Brian. "I was just looking for you. What do you do here." 
"This is the path to run that I always use in the winter to warm up!" answered the other fox.


chat

amused

passive
They started to chat together for a while, and both of them were amused to listen to what happened to them the last few weeks. The day was brightened by their laugh.
And if they had already this much fun in the winter, you can imagine how their friendship will florish in summer with sunshine and with the possiblity to have a bath in the warm water of the river crossing the forest.
