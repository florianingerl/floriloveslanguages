Had Brian climbed more carefully, he might not have fallen off the tree and would not have broken his left leg.

Katy was itching to climb the tree as well but after Brian's accident she didn't have the opportunity to do so. 
Instead, she quickly had to call an ambulance.

<VueExercise lg="en" :topics="['Genitiv s in English']" instruction="Make a sentence with the same meaning using a Genitiv like in the example!">
<p>Example: The accident of Brian was severe. -> Brian's accident was severe. </p>

<ol>
<li>The friend of Brian is called Katy.</li>
<li>The leg of Brian is broken.</li>
<li>The noise of the ambulance car is deafening.</li>

<li>Brian's friend is called Katy.</li>
<li>Brian's leg is broken.</li>

Everybody needs an ambulance in case of a broken leg. Although Brian's wailing on the phone was a bit exagerated, 
it helped to make the ambulance arrive more quickly.
In the hospital, Brian had the opportunity to meet very nice nurses who took good care of him while he was being examined. 
He even became friends with one of them.
<VueExercise lg="en" :topics="['In case']" instruction="Some things Brian might need in the hospital are given. Form sentences using in case like in the example!">
<p>a comic, a gameboy, a handy, some money, a diary, a towel</p>

<p>Example: Brian, you should bring a comic to the hospital just in case you become bored and need something to read.</p>
<VueHideShow lg="en">
<ul>
<li>Bring a handy in case you need to phone your dad.</li>
<li>Bring some money in case you want to buy food from the trolley.</li>
<li>Bring a diary in case you want to write down your hospital memories.</li>
<li>Bring a towel in case they haven't got any in the hospital.</li>
</ul>

Her name was Sonja and her blue eyes were as beautiful as the moon. Or at least, 
Brian forgot completely about his broken limb when he looked at her smile.
Although Katy was glad that Brian got the help he needed, she was not that pleased and frowned upon his new friendship 
with Sonja, because secretly she was in love with Brian.

<VueExercise lg="en" :topics="['Conjunctions']" instruction="Fill in the gaps with the conjunction that fits!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :same="true" :gaptexts="['{Although|} Brian had a broken limb, he didn\'t feel bad, {because|} the Sonja\'s beautiful smile cheered him up.',
'{While|} the moon was shining into Brian\'s face, the latter was fast asleep.',
'Sonja smiled in a way {such that|} all men turned their head towards her.']">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>


To keep Brian away from Sonja, Katy told Brian that she knew the story of a nurse who had only been friendly to her patients
 in order to be mentioned in their testament.
"Were I to keep this a secret from you, I would worry that your feelings get hurt if Sonja turns out to be this nurse. 
I'm trying to protect you!" said Katy when Brian didn't believe her.

<VueExercise lg="en" :topics="['Plural or singular']" instruction="Fill in the gaps by either the plural or the singular!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptexts="['{The health|The healths} of the patients in a hospital is often bad and gets worse there.',
'Sonja wants to be mentioned in her patients\' {testament|testaments}.',
'{The brain|The brains} of some doctors is presumably rather small because they always treat {their patients|their patient} with poison.']" >

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

But Brian didn't really listen to this nonsense and itched to bond with Sonja whose eyes he was in love with.
Katy was used to Brian not listening to her but she was stubborn and decided to investigate about Sonja to make sure 
she was a good person.
<VueExercise lg="en" :topcis="['used to do sth or get/be used to doing sth']" instruction="Fill in the gaps by used to do sth or get/be used to doing sth!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptexts="['Brian {is used to|used to} several women running after him at the same time.',
'Sonja {is used to|used to} patients calling for help at midnight.',
'In earlier days, doctors {used to|were used to} treat their patients with certains herbs and good nutrition. Nowadays, treating patients with poison is a much more lucrative business.']">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

"Should it turn out that the nurse Sonja was guilty, Brian would surely abandon her and maybe she had a chance then again. 
So Katy started her investigations by talking to the old students of Sonja's.
By the time one of Sonja's old patients agreed to talk to her, Brian had already asked the nurse out on a date. 
So Katy had to hurry if she wanted to prevent his friend falling completely in love with Sonja.

<VueExercise lg="en" :topics="['Inverted conditional sentences']" instruction="Form correct inverted conditional sentences!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptexts="['{Were Katy to tell|Would Katy tell} the truth, she would confess her love to Brian.',
'{Should Sonja need money|If Sonja needs money}, she just needs to wait until one of her partients dies and make sure that she\'s mentioned in the testament.',
'{Had Brian not fallen|If Brian has not fallen} off the tree, he wouldn\'t have met Sonja.']">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

That first old patient Katy talked to had once been a breathtaking young women, but not any more after she had fallen face foward
 from a tree and had arrived at the hospital with her face covered with scars and blue and yellow bruises.


<VueExercise lg="en" :topics="['Vocabulary on a tree']" instruction="Fill in the gaps by the correct word that has something to do with trees!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :same="true" :gaptexts="['In automn, the {leaves|} fall off the trees.',
'With its {roots|}, the tree pulls water out of the ground.',
'The older a tree is, the more rings its {trunk|} has.',
'A lot of {branches|} are connected to the trunk of a tree.',
'You call a very small branch a {twig|}.' ]">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

Katy felt sympathy for this poor woman instantly. Her name was Amanda and she had an incredible story to tell
 about the nurse Sonja. Katy was so excited that she even took notes about every word Amanda told her.
The accusations of Amanda were as follows:
Amanda had been told lies by Sonja
Amanada had been fooled by Sonja
Amanda had not been given food by Sonja but Sonja had eaten it all herself

<VueExercise lg="en" :topics="['The passive voice']" instruction="Put the words in the sentences in the correct order!">
<VueWordOrder lg="en" :sentences="['Sonja is accused by Amanda.',
'']">

</VueWordOrder>
</VueExercise>

And this list went on and on....
By dinner time, Katy had a notebook full of the accusations about Sonja. The worst one was that she gave the wrong medication to Amanda because she was jealous of Amanda's beauty. These pills didn't help her injuries to heal but on the contrary, they made it worse and created a lot of scars.
If Amanda hadn't been that poorly treated by Sonja, her scars and bruises might have healed more quickly. By this time, it all didn't matter, because Amanda had regained her gorgeous beauty simply by leaving the hospital and getting back to healthy nutrition.
After finishing the conversation and thanking Amanda for her time, Katy hurried back to the hospital. She pranced into Brian's room, eager to tell him the news that she had discovered that afternoon.
When Brian heard all of this, despite of his broken limb, he jumped fiercely out of this bed
and looked for the nurse. Having found her, he spat in front of her and said: "I have just heard about the story of how you treated Amanda! That behaviour of yours is really disgusting! Keep far away from me!"
Sonja didn't like how Brian talked to her so she had him and Katy thrown out of the hospital. Katy was over the moon that Brian was no longer in love with Sonja and she had a chance again to seduce him. 

"Let's go to a restaurant, then home." She suggested and so they went to celebrate their friendship with a nice dinner.
