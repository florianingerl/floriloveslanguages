The cat didn't really need his bag.

But his phone was in the bag so he stayed close by the bag just in case he had a call from his manager who was a very strict cat and he was afraid of missing his call.
The cat, whose name was Gareth by the way, would be given instructions by his manager on how to proceed with the following difficult matter:
Unhappily, Gareth accepted these intructions because he needed to keep his job and earn a living to be able to support his nine small kittens and his beautiful cat wife. However, the matter was really delicate and difficult so he had to work a lot.
Time to explain this in a bit more detail. The cat worked as a detective.

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="You think that our cat detective should bring these things on his missions. Form sentences with in case by linking each item with its justification">
<p>Items: a razor, an umbrella, a cell phone, <span style="{text-decoration: line-through }">a watch</span>, a map</p>
<p>Justification: it may rain, <span style="{text-decoration: line-through}">the cat might want to know the exact time</span>, the cat might get lost, the cat might want to get rid of its long hair, the might might get bored and want to play a game</p>
<p>Example: Take a watch in case you need to know the exact time</p>

A female customer had consulted their detective company, because she had no trust in her husband anymore and wanted them to survey her husband, check where he goes, who he meets, and so on...
Genuinely speaking, hard work!
Despite his strict manager and the hard work, Gareth loved his job and he was committed to survey this cat to his best abilities. So when his manager assigned him the mission, he said:
 "I will do my best, sir!"

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with any,no, anybody, nobody, anything or nothing!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :same="true" :gaptexts="['The cat doesn\'t want to eat {any|} fish today.',
'{No|} fish is allowed in her diet because fish make her fat.',
'As a detective, the cat does\'t trust {anybody|}.',
'From long experience, the cat knows that {nobody|} can be trusted.',
'Not even her father does the cat tell {anything|} about her missions.',
'The cat also had better to tell her father {nothing} about her salary.']">
</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

Gareth had already followed the husband of that jealous wife until the restroom.
That the husband had stayed there for 2 hours was indeed suspicious. A business like that doesn't take that long! So further inquiries were necessary.
Gareth stayed nearby the restroom door and while watching the door, he started to come up with ideas for this strange behaviour. First, he thought that this cat had an affaire but during the two hours, there was no female cat going in or out. So he had to think more...

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with the given verb in either the past progressive or the simple past!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptexts="['While the cat {was sitting} (sit) on a loo in the restroom, her cell phone suddenly {rang} (ring).',
'While the cat {was talking} (talk) to her boss, somebody turned (turn) the lights of the restroom off.',
'While the cat {was trying} (try) to find her way out of the restroom in the dark, a neighbouring cubicle suddenly {exploded}(explode).']">
</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

Suddenly, a deafening sound came out of the cabin. Was this the sound of a non-well-digested piece of meat?
Gareth wasn't sure but he had no choice than to stay and keep waiting. When his client's husband finally showed up from the cabin, he smiled at Gareth, not knowing that Gareth was there to spy on him.
"What have you done in that cabin for 2 hours?" Gareth wanted to know. Although detectives usually don't act like that, Gareth chose fo this direct option because he wanted to finish the job quickly and spend time with his family.
"I think my wife packed me some expired food for lunch. You know, we don't really have a good marriage. Sometimes I think she wants to poison me. But luckily, I'm feeling alright now, answered the suspicious cat.

<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with an adjective out of suspicious, precious, ostentatious and superstitious!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :same="true" :gaptexts="['The cat wears a very {precious|}, golden watch on her left arm.',
'The {superstitious|} cat always gets up at exactly 4:44 a.m. because it thinks that this will bring her luck.',
'The cat always parks her Ferrari {ostentatiously|} directly in front of her father\'s house to boast around with her richness.'
]">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

Not being sure whether Gareth should believe him or not, he just nodded his head as an answer.
"If I knew what else your wife does wrong, I would be able to help you by talking to her. You probably don't know, that your wife consulted the detective company I work for and paid a lot of money in order to have you tracked down."
Gareth knew that he had just broken his promise to stay in the shadows as a detective by declaring who he was to this cat, but suddenly he had a strange feeling that maybe it was the wife who was doing something bad.


<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Fill in the gaps with the correct phrasal verb with up or down!">
<VueMCGaps lg="en" :gaptexts="['You still have to pay for the meeting although you didn\'t {show|hide|appear} up.',
'The cat detective {laid|brought|said} down all the evidence in front of the judge.',
'The accused husband could not {bring|take|go} up any defences in front of the judge.']">

</VueMCGaps>
</VueExercise>

"I will try to sum up what my wife does wrong: First of all, she never shuts up and always talks although I desperately need silence. Secondly, she gets up too early and wakes me up too while doing it. And last but not least, she never finishes a project but always gives up once a small obstacle gets in her way. Observing that demotivates me."
"Hm, what I thought before was completely wrong. I believed that you were up to something illegal. But now I just think you need couple therapy with your wife to save your marriage."
"Luckily, I have already had 5 women and that's why I am an expert in these matters and exactly the right person to help you. Most important thing to understand: Talking or explaining more to your wife is of no use. Concerning the poisoned food your wife gives you: If eating it is not an option, just burry it somewhere and thank your wife for it.
<VueExercise lg="en" instruction="Put the words in the correct order to form sentences!">
<VueWordOrder lg="en" :sentences="['I have never had a relationship.',
'I haven\'t had a relationship yet.',
'I can always occupy myself with English books.'
]">

</VueWordOrder>
</VueExercise>

"Thank you for your great advice, I will keep it in mind. However, I'm not sure this will be enough to fix our relationship. Actually, I'm planning to escape in secret to Africa next week. Please don't tell her."
But that's a really great idea! I have always wanted a holiday in Africa. Your wife will pay my company so I can track you down until Africa and I will be able to give you more advice there. If you want to visit other places after Africa, your wife will probably also pay for it.
"That's a wonderful idea because I hate to travel alone so I'm happy if you can come with me in this way."
In the end, this mission turned into an amazing travel experience for Gareth and he was even able to form a friendship with this cat. He started to like his job and didn't even mind his manager any longer.
